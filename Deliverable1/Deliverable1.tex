\section {Agent Definitions}
In this section we briefly define the users of the system and what their roles and capabilities will be. 

\subsection{Administrator}
The administrator is responsible for monitoring the continued use of the site and making sure that it is maintained properly (i.e. banning users, introducing new sections/genres, implementing promotions, and updating the current stock).

\subsection{Business Manager}
The business manager is responsible for creating promotions based on the popularity of items. The business manager should be able to keep track of the businesses sales and popularity over time. 

\subsection{Shopper}
A shopper is a person who has just happened upon the website, but has not yet registered as a member. A shopper is able to use the website in that he or she is able to view the details of books and is able to add the books to their card; however, a shopper is not able to check out (i.e. place a purchase order) until after they have gone through the registration process and have become a member. 

\subsection{Member}
A member is a user who has already registered with their email, username, and password. A member is allowed to use all of the functionality of the site and is able to place orders (given that they have valid payment info etc). Members will also have the ability to view and change their account details including their order history. 

\subsection{Supplier}
A supplier is a provider of books to the store. Suppliers should maintain a manifest of the books that they are able to supply to the store. Suppliers can add new books to their manifest and can update the stock available for existing items. 


\subsection{Shipment Department}
The shipment department is responsible for carrying out the delivery of orders after they have been placed. The shipment agency should be able to send users emails regarding the shipment of their ordered products, and will keep track of all shipments internally.
